Topology Layout Integration Test

This is a test application to verify that the following topology layout compiles and runs for 1-3 workers. The included Makefile will run an integration test with a given input and an expected output to verify results. Those tests are run as part of CI.

Single Stream to Single Sink
Single Pipeline
Parallel Stateless Computation
State Partition (there will be three partitions)
Parallel Stateless Computation
