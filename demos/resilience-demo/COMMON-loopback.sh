# Copy/symlink this file to COMMON.sh to use a single machine with Wallaroo
# workers all listening to different IP addresses on the loopback interface.
# For OS X/macOS, prepare by using these commands:
#
#    ln -s /path/to/your/wallaroo/source/repo $HOME/wallaroo
#    rm -f $HOME/wallaroo/demos/resilience-demo/COMMON.sh
#    ln -s ./COMMON-loopback.sh $HOME/wallaroo/demos/resilience-demo/COMMON.sh

# Common variables for controlling the other scripts in this directory.
# I have been testing these scripts using AWS EC2 instances of type
# t3.medium + AMI: Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type,
# ami-04169656fea786776 in the us-east-1 region.

# Assumptions:
#
# 1. The machine that runs these scripts need not be a cluster member
#    machine, e.g., run on your Wallaroo Labs laptop/desktop from home.
#
# 2. All machines must permit SSH access via both their external *and*
#    internal IP addresses.
#    a). SSH from your laptop to each cluster member.
#    b). SSH used by rsync from one cluster member directly to another
#        via internal network addresses.
#
# 3. The Wallaroo source repo exists on $SERVER1 in the directory
#    $HOME/wallaroo.  All other servers will have $HOME/wallaroo
#    created by rsync from $SERVER1 -> target.
#
# 4. Each machine is running Ubuntu Linux or something similar,
#    supported by Wallaroo Up.  (Wallaroo Up files are assumed to be
#    in the $HOME/wallaroo-tutorial directory.)
#
# 5. For on/off variables defined here, valid values are only "y" and "n".

# External IP addresses for each of the 4 machines in this cluster.
# Must be routable by the machine that executes these scripts.

# network interface, then define as SERVER1=$SERVER1_EXT, etc.
# The internal IP addresses are useful in environments like AWS EC2.

SERVER3=$SERVER3_EXT

# URL for the Wallaroo source repo
# The scripts will only clone this repo once and will not fail/interrupt
# the scripts if the repo already exists.  It's up to the user to manage
# the repo with Git "fetch" & "pull" commands as appropriate, if you're
# doing active code development or debugging.
