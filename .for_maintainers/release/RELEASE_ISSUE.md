# Release Issue Creation

This document is aimed at members of the Wallaroo team who might be cutting a release of Wallaroo. This file should guide you in creating the release issue needed to document testing for the release candidate branch.

## Release Issue Template

The Release Issue Template is used to create the release issue for the release candidate branch that will be tested. It is a living document and should be updated if any additional testing is added to the issue. The template can be found [here](RELEASE_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md). The target dates for Phase 1 and Phase 2 should be updated for the specific release you are releasing, along with the proper release number and link to the release milestone.
