  # MetricsSink

  `MetricsSink` replaces the Pony standard library class `TCPConnection`
  within Wallaroo for outgoing connections for metrics. While
  `TCPConnection` offers a number of excellent features it doesn't
  account for our needs around encoding of output messages in the sink.

  `MetricsSink` is a copy of `TCPConnection` with
  support for a behavior for sending metrics.
